## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

One of my main learnings has been the validations that need to be added to the code if you want everything to work correctly. Besides that I have learned how to gradually integrate and join all the components that are on a page, this time making two and making them both go together.

```js
function saveAddress() {
    const correo = emailInput.value;
    const url = 'subscribing.html?correo=' + encodeURIComponent(correo);
    window.location.href = url;
};

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    const correo = urlParams.get('correo');

    if (correo) {
        console.log(correo);
        emailSave.textContent = correo;
    }
})
```

### Continued development

I need to focus a little more on making everything go more smoothly in terms of the way I work, however, I know exactly where to do what without getting confused; as for something technical I think I will focus on responsive, since this time it has cost me a little more and I want to get better at it.

### Useful resources

- [Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'textContent')](https://es.stackoverflow.com/questions/490941/uncaught-typeerror-cannot-set-properties-of-null-setting-textcontent) - This helped me with a bug that I kept getting when coding but I was able to fix it thanks to this resource.
